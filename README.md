## Short description about Blog|Nation:

We are a group of six people who go fourth year technology on IT high school in Sk√∂vde, Sweden. We have created a blog manager we call Blog Nation. Our blog manager is very user-friendly you will get very good experience hopefully. Do you have interests? Why not create multiple blogs so that you can easily structure your interests you want to share. Do a post that you like or agree with, you can like, comment and even favoring the post so that you can easily find the way back to the post.

We have worked on this project over a four week period and we are very pleased with what we accomplished. We hope that you as a user finds our blog manager as the most optimal place to create blogs and share your life / your interests.
